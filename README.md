This is an assignment for CS211S at [City College of San Francisco](http://www.ccsf.edu/).
 
This program demonstrates some statistical data processed to answer a few simple questions:

* Which district of San Francisco has had the most violent crimes in the last 16 years?
* Which year (excluding 2018) has been the most violent?

The statistical data used in this program was originally taken from [here](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry) and was
filtered to a subset of only the most relevant data to the questions above.
